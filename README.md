[**Abstract:**]{} [*500 words maximum (4000 character maximum).*]{} The
abstract should contain a concise summary and mention acquired and
prepared data sets as well as possibilities for reusing those data sets.
However, no new scientific findings should be presented here. (No
citations may be included in the abstract.)

[**1. Background & Summary**]{}

In this section, authors must explain the background of research that
served as the basis for prepared data and explain the composition of
that research with citations where necessary. They must also mention
their motivation and purpose for preparing the data as well as the
dataâ€™s value.[*(1000 words maximum)*]{}

[**2. Location (or Observation)**]{}

Using maps, authors must explain the locations at which they acquired
data or made observations. For data or observations extending over a
broad area, they must explain the geographical limits of the target area
and the spatial resolution.

[**3. Methods**]{}

In this section, authors must describe the processing process they used
when preparing data, such as the methods they used to acquire data or
conduct observations, with citations as necessary. In the case of
observations, they must provide details on the equipment that were used
and describe the hardware, software, and other tools that were used.
They must also include photos of the equipment and illustrations of
observation systems. If they used a specific type of software to prepare
data, they must describe how that software was obtained. Authors must
describe their methods in a manner that will make reproduction possible
by a third party that acquires similar data and makes similar
observations. Authors may cite other literature with regard to methods
for data acquirement and observation; however, they must describe these
methods as well as a method for reproducing the processing process.
Authors may not omit the methods and processing process for the reason
of having cited other literature.

[**4. Data Records**]{}

Authors should use this section to explain data records that pertain to
this report. They must explain the data files and their formats so that
other researchers can reuse them by reading this section. Tables showing
the data structure should be used for explanation of presented data
sets. Additionally, even if prepared data formats use software that is
generally applicable to all fields, authors must provide a method that
is reusable by a third party by noting the manner in which the software
was obtained, the version that was used, a method for reading the data
using the software, and other relevant details.

[**5. Technical Validation**]{}

In this section, authors must provide the method they used to support
the technical quality of the data sets. They should make their
explanation using figures and tables when necessary. This is a required
section; authors must provide information that legitimizes the
reliability of their data. One of the following items should be
included:

-   Details on the data gathering procedure or method used in quality
    evaluation

-   Statistical errors in the data

[**6. Usage Notes (optional)**]{}

In this section, authors can describe any points that should be kept in
mind when using data.

[**7. Competing interests (optional)**]{}

Data management plans designated by sources of funding may be provided
here.(Because there are cases in which overseas funding organizations
require the publication of data sets to be noted within one year, or the
publication of those sets in this repository, as conditions for funding,
those conditions can be described here.)

[**8. Figures (optional)**]{}

The figures and these legends can include up to a maximum of four that
present main data points of the published data in a â€œquick lookâ€ format.

[**9. Tables (optional)**]{}

Tables may include main data points of the published data. However, this
is acceptable only for tables arranged in a summarized format.

[**Author contributions**]{}

This section must explain concisely the contributions made by each
author in the following manner: A did this and that. B did this, that,
and the other. The contribution of each author must be described.

[**Acknowledgements**]{}

The acknowledgements must be kept concise and include contributions from
people who are not counted among the authors. There is no need to
include referees and editors in the acknowledgements. Projects that
gathered data and sources of funding can be included here.

[**References**]{}

Provide bibliographic information for any works cited in the above
sections, using the standard SIST referencing style. References are each
numbered, ordered sequentially as they appear in the text. When cited in
the text, reference numbers are superscript, not in brackets unless they
are likely to be confused with a superscript number. All authors should
be included in reference lists unless there are more than five, in which
case only the first author should be given, followed by et al.
